**Welcome to XOOPS Cube Documentation**

**XOOPS Cube** is a web application platform : a simple, secure and scalable modular architecture built with PHP, SQL and a smarty powered theming system. The BSD License allows proprietary use and allows the software released under the license to be incorporated into proprietary products. 

**Modules** and **Preloads** (single file extension) or **Themes** are released under BSD, CC, GPL and MIT licenses. Empowering everyone to create dynamic and content rich websites with ease - from the best looking blogs, portfolios, community forums, intranet and business websites to the much safer desktop applications on Linux, Mac or Windows.

The latest **XCL** release avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues and the design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable **Cube Core** — Modular design combine the advantages of standardization with those of customization through an intuitive graphical user interface to manage functionality and localization for flexible and extensible production.

## Requirements

Whether you plan to create your own personal or corporate community web site with news, forums, blog, photo album, portfolio, etc. You need a reliable Web Host running Apache, MySQL and PHP.

XOOPS Cube will run smoothly on a LAMP environment. In most cases your site will be hosted on the popular open source web platform consisting of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Though XOOPS Cube can run on any other Operating System (OS) as well.

XOOPS Cube 2.1 has high compatibility with the earlier XOOPS 2.0.x. We recommend the last modules generation, known as Cube modules and D3 modules which can be easily duplicated and renamed but also provide a GUI to manage the language catalog and templates.
XOOPS Cube functionality can also be easily extended with Preloads - one file class based extension.
