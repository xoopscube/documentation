### Simple  

**XOOPSCUBE Legacy (XCL)** stands as a free and open-source Web Application Platform (WAP, CMS), providing webmasters with the power to effortlessly 
build dynamic and content-rich websites. The user-friendly XCL bundle package is engineered to leverage the performance of the XCube Core alongside the widely adopted web server stack: Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Installation is a breeze – simply clone the repository or extract the ZIP archive into a directory within your website's root, open your web browser, and launch the intuitive installation wizard, available in English, Français, 日本語, Português, Pусский.

### Secure

XCube Core is inherently secure by design, a principle in software engineering indicating that security is a fundamental aspect of its architecture and capabilities. This Legacy system ensures backward compatibility with older XOOPS2 and subsequent XOOPS2-JP Japanese versions, which offered support for multibyte characters. The Protector module is included to enhance the security of the base system, providing an additional layer of protection for the Legacy component. Furthermore, the platform's extensibility is achieved without modifying core files, thanks to the delegate mechanism and the preload system (single file components) within an event-driven environment.

### Scalable

Scaling a web application platform involves enabling a greater number of users to access a website and accommodating increasing demand by expanding the core functionality and facilitating migration to larger storage and more powerful servers with, all with a simple migration process while maintaining the reliability of your core system.

### Self-Host

Self-hosted platforms offer a decentralized architecture, allowing unparalleled accessibility for customizing both functionality and appearance. This independence liberates you from reliance on a centralized service, granting you the freedom to select your preferred hosting provider. This autonomy ensures exceptional scalability as your user base expands, allowing you to adapt and grow your resources according to your specific needs, free from the constraints of costly third-party services like cloud or SaaS solutions. Furthermore, you maintain complete control over your own data and services, eliminating dependence on these expensive external providers. (cloud, saas).
