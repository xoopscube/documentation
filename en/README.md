### The XCube core concept "3S" stands for â€” Simple, Secure and Scalable.**

The XCube architecture was developed to address the limitations of existing web development frameworks and to provide a new foundation for innovation while extending the lifespan of the XOOPS2 Content Management System through the base system Legacy, thus ensuring backward compatibility. This approach, born from real-world experience, resulted in a highly modular and extensible platform designed for reliable resource management and scalability.

### Extensible Modular Architecture

The best way to describe an extensible modular architecture in terms of development is that it's a software design paradigm focused on building systems as a collection of independent, self-contained units (modules) that can be easily added, removed, replaced, and updated without significantly impacting the rest of the system. This promotes flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.
