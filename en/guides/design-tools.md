Workspaces enable you to save a change that you make in Devtools to a local copy of the same file on your computer. For example, suppose:

You have the source code for your site on your desktop.
You're running a local web server from the source code directory, so that the site is accessible at localhost:8080.
You've got localhost:8080 open in Google Chrome, and you're using DevTools to change the site's CSS.
With Workspaces enabled, the CSS changes that you make within DevTools are saved to the source code on your desktop.
