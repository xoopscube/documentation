The Strategy pattern is used to handle situations where different algorithms or behaviors need to be selected at runtime, allowing a class to dynamically change its behavior without modifying its core logic. This is achieved by encapsulating each algorithm into a separate strategy class and letting the client choose which one to use based on the context. 

Core Idea:

Encapsulation:
Each algorithm is encapsulated within its own strategy class, promoting modularity and reducing code duplication.

Flexibility:
The client code can select and switch between different strategies at runtime, providing flexibility and adaptability.

Decoupling:
The context (the class using the strategy) is decoupled from the specific implementation of the algorithm, allowing the context to remain unchanged while the behavior can be swapped. 

When to Use:

Dynamic Algorithm Selection:
When the algorithm to be used is determined at runtime based on varying conditions. 

Multiple Algorithms:
When a class needs to handle a family of algorithms for a specific task, according to Refactoring.Guru. 

Avoiding Complex Conditional Logic:
When large if-else or switch statements are used to choose between different behaviors. 

Extensibility:
When new algorithms can be easily added without modifying existing code, following the Open-Closed Principle, says a Medium article. 

Benefits:

Modularity:
Each strategy is a separate class, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. 

Flexibility:
Algorithms can be swapped out at runtime, allowing the system to adapt to changing requirements. 

Readability:
Complex conditional logic is eliminated, improving the readability and maintainability of the code. 

Extensibility:
New algorithms can be added without modifying existing code. 

Example:
Imagine a scenario where a shopping cart needs to support different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.). The Strategy pattern can be used to define different payment strategies (one for each payment method) and let the client choose which strategy to use based on the user's selection. 

In essence, the Strategy pattern provides a powerful way to handle situations where algorithms need to be chosen dynamically, promoting flexibility, modularity, and maintainability in your code
