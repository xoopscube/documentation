Welcome to the documentation for XOOPSCube Legacy (XCL), an open-source web application platform built using PHP and MySQL, with a rich history and innovation community. This project, hosted at <a href="https://github.com/xoopscube/legacy" target="_blank">https://github.com/xoopscube/legacy</a>, represents a significant evolution in content management and web application development.

This documentation is structured to guide you through the key components of XOOPSCube Legacy Project. 

To provide an understanding of its architecture and capabilities, we will explore two distinct yet interconnected parts of the system:

- [XCube Core](/en/development/): This section delves into the modern architectural foundation of the platform. It outlines the the core design concept that underpins the structure and subsequent development of the base system Legacy. The platform giving required minimum functionality to aggregate preexistent base systems, and design patterns for building robust and extensible web applications within the XCube ecosystem. Understanding the core is essential for leveraging the platform's full potential for new development.

- [Legacy System (XCL)](/en/development/): Recognizing the importance of continuity and the ecosystem of existing modules and customizations, XOOPSCube incorporates a dedicated Legacy system (XCL). This section explains how this layer provides backward compatibility with modules and code developed for earlier versions. It details how this bridge allows for a smoother transition and continued support for established functionalities.

By understanding both the modern XCube Core and the backward-compatible Legacy System (XCL), developers can effectively build new applications, maintain existing ones, and contribute to the ongoing evolution of the XOOPSCube Legacy project.
