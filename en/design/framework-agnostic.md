## Web frameworks

<p>A web development framework is a set of resources and tools for software developers to build and manage 
web applications, web services and websites. 
There are countless frameworks and technologies that can be used to build a web platform or service.
While the tools and services of existing development frameworks are useful in many use cases, 
the most popular frameworks often come with high costs in terms of resource requirements, development 
and deployment - as well as serious limitations in the integration of components — thus a rather 
poor cost-benefit ratio.</p>

<p>Beyond the rather simple observation of benchmarks comparing technologies, 
it is absolutely necessary to take into account the results. 
Indeed, it is not only the speed of development of your web platform that is important, 
but also the necessary resources and the undeniable financial cost in production.</p>

## Self-Hosted Scalable

**The XCube core concept "3S" stands for — Simple, Secure and Scalable.**

The XCube architecture was developed to overcome these limitations, and to serve as the basis for 
extending an existing web platform. 
The approach stems from real-world experience, resulting in a highly modular and extensible platform 
for reliable resource management and scalability in a very demanding domain. 
Self-hosted platforms are decentralized, allow for superior accessibility,
and full control over your own data and services, rather than depending on expensive third-party services (cloud, saas).
