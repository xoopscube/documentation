Welcome to the documentation for XCL Theme and Template Engine! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to control and customize the visual presentation of both the user-facing frontend and the administrative backend of the application.

The theme system is a cornerstone of the platform's flexibility, allowing for significant modifications to the appearance and layout without altering the core application logic. This separation is achieved through a powerful Render System and template engine powered by Smarty which processes template files containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and specific template tags.

Understanding the theme system is crucial whether you want to make minor style adjustments, ensure brand consistency, or create entirely unique designs. This documentation is structured to guide you through the different aspects:

* **Frontend Theme System:** Learn how the themes for the public-facing parts of the website are structured, how templates are loaded, and which variables and functions are available for customization.

* **Backend Theme System:** Discover the specifics of theming the administrative interface, including its unique structure and available customization options.

* **Creating Custom Themes:** A step-by-step guide on how to build your own themes from scratch or by modifying existing ones for both frontend and backend environments.

* **Examples and Tips:** Practical examples, code snippets, best practices, and troubleshooting tips to help you effectively work with themes and templates.

Whether you are a site administrator looking to apply a pre-built theme, a designer aiming to tweak the visuals, or a developer building a completely custom user experience, this guide provides the necessary information to master the theme and template engine. Let's dive in!
