## <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:about"></span> The Project

**The XOOPSCube Project** is Open Source, friendly maintained, developed and supported by a volunteer group to expand the vision of a free internet integrating everyone's creativity and skills. A shared vision and the OSS guiding principles made the original project's strategy that is at the very beginning of the innovation process. Since 2005, XCube modularity in design and the freedom of choice allows developers and designers to use their favorite frameworks and libraries for their intended uses by end users. The fundamental building blocks of the project are the innovative concept **3S** that stands for: Simple, Secure, Scalable.

### Secure

XCube Core (©2005 Kazuhisa Minato, BSD) is secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.
However, the module Protector (©peak.ne.jp) is installed to provide an extra layer of security to the subsystem Legacy — which ensures backwards compatibility with the older system XOOPS2 (©2002 Kazumi Ono @Onokazu, GPL2) and later XOOPS2-JP Japanese versions with multibyte character support.

### Scalable 

Scaling a web application platform means allowing more people to use the application and being able to meet increasing demand, without changing the code, data or the trusted system. You can easily extend core functionality with modules or a new subsystem. XCube core provides many essential tools for maintaining a web platform and offers a great deal of functionality and customization options for your Content Management System. In fact, the customization options for your Web Application Platform and CMS-driven websites are nearly endless with preloads (single file component).

### Self-Host

Self-hosted platforms are decentralized, allow for superior accessibility, customization of features and style, which means you are not dependent on a centralized service and are also free to choose your hosting service as the number of users grows.   
You have full control over your own data and services, rather than depending on expensive third-party services (cloud, saas).

**XOOPS** is an acronym of "eXtensible Object Oriented Portal System". Though started as a portal system, it later developed into a web application framework. It aims to serve as a web framework for use by small, medium and large sites, through the installation of modules. 

On the New Year’s Day of 2002, XOOPS RC1 was released to the public (©2002 Kazumi Ono @Onokazu, GPL2). The original XOOPS code was based on PHP-Nuke 4.4.1 and myPHPNuke 1.8.5, although some 70-80 percent of the code was rewritten, as Kazumi Ono wrote on the release announcement. By the end of May 2002, the team had released three point versions, and XOOPS moved to a server in Japan. 

**XOOPSCube** forked from later XOOPS2-JP Japanese version with multibyte character support to develop a new distribution package and follow a different path development with the new XCube Core (©2005 Kazuhisa Minato @minahito) and a modular architecture. The fork started by Kazuhisa Minato was announced by Kazumi Ono in May 2005 and joined by the former Xoops Japan Team, who felt that security and multi-byte character support were not adequately addressed by the former Xoops management team.

 **The XOOPSCube Team** maintained Xoops 2.0.x JP series, a temporary branch for Japanese community, while developing XOOPSCube — the new Web Application Platform (WAP) and Content Management System (CMS). **The XCube core** was developed from scratch by Kazuhisa Minato (lead programmer in the game industry) and the new base subsystem **Legacy** was developed to ensure backwards compatibility with a set of modules for interoperability with the older XOOPS2 system.

XoopsCube Legacy 2.1.0 final was released on April 30, 2007. Meanwhile, many other developers and users joined the project improving translations, user interface design and usability. Gijoe developed the very distinct and unique feature of duplicatable modules (D3) and the community contributed in many ways to improve the core and the release of several D3 modules. A new Package Legacy was released on july 28, 2012.

Since then The XOOPSCube Project is led by highly skilled developers Kilica (XCCK, Content Creation Kit) and Nao-pon (Xelfinder, file manager) ensuring that development follows the values and principles of Open Source. 

## <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:multiple-devices"></span> The XCL 

**XCL is the bundle package** coming out in 2019. **XCL** refers to the excellent design of the modular architecture composed of separate components that can be connected together. The XCL 2.3.0 release integrates Xelfinder, a filemanager with cloud support, a wysiwyg content editor with granular permissions and X-Updater to install and manage modules, themes and extensions. So site owners benefit from PHP7 performance and high level of security, a new intuitive GUI and user-friendly CMS while maintaining full control over their own data.

Moreover, the latest XCL development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues. The design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable modular design of **XCube Core**. Thus improving the management of internationalization and localization, customization and personalization for flexible and extensible production with a free choice of frameworks and libraries.

## <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:reading"></span> The X-Codex 

The documentation is built on top of Docsify using a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The X-Codex documentation can be easily edited locally or on Github and it is composed of the following parts: 

+ Overview and set up of your XCL application
+ Development environment with open source software
+ Guidelines to start a project and set yourself up for success
+ Continuous delivery to synchronize deployements and update projects in a sustainable way.
+ Tutorials to get started quickly with Customization, Personalization and Contribution.
