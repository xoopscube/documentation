## <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:about"></span> The Project

The project was Open Source, maintained, developed, and supported by a group of volunteers to broaden the vision of a free Internet integrating everyone’s creativity and skills. A shared vision to create a framework-agnostic web application platform, which was at the very beginning of the innovation process, and the guiding principles of OSS constituted the strategy of the original project.

Since 2005, XCube’s architecture and modularity in design, along with the freedom of choice of development tools, allowed developers and designers to use their favorite frameworks and libraries. The fundamental principles of the project were at the origin of the innovative 3S concept which stood for: Simple, Secure, Scalable.

## Brief History

**XOOPS** is an acronym of "eXtensible Object Oriented Portal System", according to the core developer Kazumi Ono. 
Though started as a portal system, it later developed into a web application framework. 
It aimed to serve as a web framework for use by small, medium and large sites, through the installation of modules. 

On the New Year’s Day of 2002, XOOPS RC1 was released to the public (©2002 Kazumi Ono @Onokazu, GPL2). 
The original XOOPS code was based on PHP-Nuke 4.4.1 and myPHPNuke 1.8.5, although some 70-80 percent of the code was rewritten, as Kazumi Ono wrote on the release announcement. By the end of May 2002, the team had released three point versions, and XOOPS moved to a server in Japan. 

**XOOPSCube** forked from later XOOPS2-JP Japanese version with multibyte character support to develop a 
new distribution package and follow a different path development with the new XCube Core (©2005 Kazuhisa Minato @minahito) 
and a modular architecture. 
The fork started by Kazuhisa Minato was announced by Kazumi Ono in May 2005 and joined by the former Xoops Japan Team, 
who felt that security and multi-byte character support were not adequately addressed by the former Xoops management team.

**The XOOPSCube Team** maintained Xoops 2.0.x JP series, a temporary branch for Japanese community, 
while developing XOOPSCube — the new Web Application Platform (WAP) and Content Management System (CMS). 
**The XCube core** was developed from scratch by Kazuhisa Minato (lead programmer in the game industry) 
and the new base subsystem **Legacy** was developed to ensure backwards compatibility with a set of modules 
for interoperability with the older XOOPS2 system.

XoopsCube Legacy 2.1.0 final was released on April 30, 2007. Meanwhile, many other developers and users joined the project 
improving translations, user interface design and usability. 
Gijoe developed the very distinct and unique feature of duplicatable modules (D3) and the community contributed in 
many ways to improve the core and the release of several D3 modules. 
A new Package Legacy was released on july 28, 2012.

Since then The XOOPSCube Project was led by highly skilled developers Kilica (XCCK, Content Creation Kit) 
and Nao-pon (Xelfinder, file manager) ensuring that development continued to follow the values and principles of Open Source.

## <span class="iconify" data-icon="flat-color-icons:multiple-devices"></span> XCL Package 

**XCL is the bundle package** update to PHP8. **XCL** XCL is an initialism highlighting the clever design of its modular architecture, where separate parts easily connect. Since XCL version 2.3.x, the bundle released integrates Xelfinder, a file manager with cloud support, CKEditor wysiwyg, a content editor and management with granular permissions, and X-Update Manager to deploy and install modules, themes and extensions. 
Moreover, the latest XCL development avoids constraining new designs with legacy backwards compatibility issues. 
The design process is simplified to take advantage from the extendable modular design of **XCube Core**. 
Thus improving the management of internationalization and localization, customization and personalization for 
flexible and extensible production with a free choice of frameworks and libraries.
