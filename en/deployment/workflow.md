A deployment workflow for a web application platform updates typically involves several key steps: 

preparing the new version, verifying it, testing thoroughly, approving the release, migrating to production, and then retiring old builds. 

This process often includes automated steps like uploading the binary, backing up the system, and notifying users. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Planning and Preparation:
  - Define the update:
  - Clearly outline the changes, features, and bug fixes included in the new version. 
  - Develop a deployment strategy:
  - Choose the deployment method (e.g., rolling deployment, blue-green deployment) based on the application and infrastructure. 
  - Create a deployment plan:
  - Document the steps, timelines, and responsibilities involved in the deployment process, including testing and rollback procedures. 
  - Prepare the code:
  - Build the application, package it, and ensure it's ready for deployment. 
  - Configure the environment:
  - Set up the target servers or infrastructure for the new version, including database configurations and other dependencies. 

2. Testing and Verification:
  - Unit testing: Ensure individual components of the application work as expected.
  - Integration testing: Verify that different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
  - System testing: Test the application in a simulated production environment.
  - User acceptance testing (UAT): Have users test the new version to ensure it meets their needs and requirements.
  - Performance testing: Ensure the application can handle the expected load.
  - Regression testing: Verify that new changes haven't introduced any new bugs.
  - Security testing: Check for vulnerabilities and ensure the application is secure. 

3. Approval and Deployment:
  - Review and approval: Get the necessary approvals for the release from stakeholders. 
  - Deploy to a staging environment: Test the new version in a non-production environment to ensure it works as expected before deploying it to production. 
  - Deploy to production: Push the update to the production environment where users interact with the application. 
  - Monitor performance: Use metrics and monitoring tools to track the application's performance after deployment. 
  - Alert users and colleagues: Notify users about the update and any potential downtime. 

4. Ongoing Maintenance and Monitoring:
  - Monitor for issues: Use monitoring tools to identify potential issues and address them promptly. 
  - Perform automated rollbacks: If necessary, automatically revert to the previous version in case of deployment failures. 
  - Gather feedback: Collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement. 
  - Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD): Automate the deployment process to improve speed and reliability. 
  - Example Deployment Scenarios:

Web applications:

Deploy to web servers, potentially using containerization technologies like Docker. 

Mobile applications:

Deploy through app stores (e.g., App Store, Google Play Store), or use Live Updates for web-based components. 

Cloud-native applications:

Deploy using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, often with CI/CD pipelines
