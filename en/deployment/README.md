The module **X-Update Manager** functions as a dedicated software update service (SUS) for the XOOPSCube Legacy (XCL)   
web application platform. As a core "trust module" within the XCL package, its primary purpose is to streamline the process of keeping the platform and its components up-to-date and secure.

**Key Features and Functionality:**

* **Comprehensive Updates:** Allows administrators to update the XCL core system easily.
* **Add-on Management:** Facilitates the installation and updating of various add-ons, including modules, themes, and preloads.
* **Timely Patches:** Enables the download of critical updates and security patches as soon as they become available.
* **Component Stores:** Provides access to information ("stores") about available modules, preloads, and themes.

**Scope and Limitations:**

Please note that X-Update's primary role is the installation and updating of components, acting as a discovery gateway for add-ons.  
It is not designed for creating your own modules, themes, or preloads, nor for establishing your own component store. For assistance with installing the X-Update service, please contact a developer.

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the X-Update moduleâ€™s functionality, features, and configuration.
