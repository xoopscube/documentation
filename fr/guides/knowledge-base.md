**XOOPS2** is an acronym of "eXtensible Object Oriented Portal System". Though started as a portal system,
it later developed into a web application framework. It aims to serve as a web framework for small,
medium and large sites. The first versions of XOOPS, like other Nuke derivatives such as PHP-Nuke,
were labeled as (CMS), that can be extended with modules. Webmaster can add or change some functions or
install modules. Though it is less flexible when webmasters need to customize authentication functions
or personalize web accessibility.

**Renderer** is a simple but smarty render engine.
The concepts and design decisions for the development of the rendering engine were influenced by the excellent concept
of exchangeable features implemented by 3D software (e.g. OGRE3D, or Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine).

These projects have been around since 2001 and the senior developers and designers have experimented almost every
development situation. They know how to design and how to develop robust applications with the right tools,
frameworks and libraries to efficiently overcome obstacles. It takes time and practice to build up genuine expertise.

+ Custom Legacy was planned by Tom's company. That's light-weight Legacy.

Maybe source code will be developed from scratch, and it will lose some compatibilities.
Tom said that this base module aims to D3 modules. Not sure whether it is front controller type.
The licence should be GPL, because it uses some parts of Legacy.

Oreteki Legacy was planned by Marijuana who made Oreteki-XOOPS before.

Non-DB base was planned by Ryuji. But, this is just idea, so it's uncertain whether he plans to develop or not.
It is special light-weight base module to run special modules which don't use DB. And, by XCube_Service or other
methods, these modules are attached to Legacy through Legacy's module adapter.

Onokazu's Framework is a new framework developed by Onokazu to be an independent PHP application.
But, the modules developed with this framework will be attached to XOOPSCube through the specific
base module or the specific adapter.

XUGJ/Hoda-juku Distribution is a package which includes some modules and some specific configurations :
a "right out of the box" distro. The distribution was planned by XUGJ or Hoda-Juku.
Because GIJOE is a member of them, the distribution will include his great work which is also available as moules.

Momoxo was started by Suin and supported by Ryuji and some other developers.
