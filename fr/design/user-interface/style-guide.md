A well-documented design system can play a huge part in success of any major design project. There are many systems with pro's and con's. Design systems include Component-Based Systems and Atomic Design.

Component-Based
Component-based systems are based on components or modules: re-usable chunks of code that are intended for multiple uses. It allows you to modify a module once and see it updated in every instance; have a more clear app architecture and have a unified development process. There are two common approaches when designing a website: Frameworks and Style guides.

Frameworks are very common and have been around for a while. They include Bootstrap, Materialize and Foundation.

Pro's
ready-to-use components
saves tons of time and effort
many fromwork styles are free and easy to find online

Con's
not for designers - no .sketch, .psd or other source files
deep customization requires a large amount of additional development effort and negates the very essence of a framework
for every element there will be 5 that you don’t need that slows things down

Style guides are built from scratch and you can quickly use components from it in your mock-ups

Pro's
defines what styles to use and when
reduces questions about when a component should be used
not everything needs to be mocked up: ie a form page with error states

Con's
it is difficult to trace the inheritance of components
components often get implemented not in the intended way
it can drastically decrease re-usability of your design components

Atomic Design
Atomic design is a methodology that allows (and requires) you to describe and organize every component of your design system. This approach divides design components into 5 different categories.
